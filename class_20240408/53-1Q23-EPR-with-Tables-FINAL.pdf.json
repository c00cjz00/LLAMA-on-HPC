        "text": "Gap Inc. Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Results\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 May 25, 2023 \u2013 Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS), a portfolio of purpose-led, billion-dollar lifestyle brands including Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta, and the largest specialty apparel company in the U.S., today reported financial results for its first quarter ended April 29, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe continue to take the necessary actions to drive critical change at Gap Inc., ultimately getting us back on a path toward delivering consistent results long-term,\u201d said Bob Martin, Executive Chairman and Interim CEO, Gap Inc. \u201cWhile the macro and consumer environment remain uncertain, Q1 underscores our ability to deliver improvements to the business including share gains at Old Navy and Gap Brand, adjusted operating margin expansion, reduction in inventory, and strength in our balance sheet. The need for lasting change is permeating the organization and I want to express my gratitude to our employees for embracing a new operating model and organizational structure, a renewed focus on our customer, and for their continued belief in our incredible brands.\u201d\n\n\"The Gap Inc. Board of Directors and I have deep appreciation for and confidence in the work that has taken hold under Bobby Martin and the Leadership Team, with results already showing progress, and more importantly, a collective focus on continued improvement still ahead. As we are engaged toward the appointment of a new Gap Inc. CEO to carry this work into the future, we look forward to the time when we will introduce this great company\u2019s next leader - one who will bring passion, vision and an unwavering focus on the customer,\u201d said Mayo Shattuck, Lead Independent Director, Gap Inc.\n\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2023 - Financial Results\n\n\u2022 Net sales of $3.28 billion, down 6% compared to last year, inclusive of an estimated 1-point foreign exchange headwind and 2 percentage points of negative impact from the sale of Gap China. Net sales were in line with the company\u2019s expectations for a mid-single digit decline in the quarter.\n\no Comparable sales were down 3%. o Store sales decreased 4% compared to last year. The company ended the quarter with 3,453 store locations in over 40 countries, of which 2,601 were company operated. o Online sales decreased 9% compared to last year and represented 37% of total net\n\nsales.\n\n\u2022 Reported gross margin was 37.1%. Excluding $4 million in restructuring costs, adjusted gross margin of 37.2% increased 570 basis points versus last year.\n\no Merchandise margin increased 600 basis points versus last year, or 610 basis points on an adjusted basis, due to lower air freight expense and improved promotional activity in the quarter, partially offset by inflationary cost headwinds.\n\no Rent, occupancy, and depreciation (ROD) deleveraged 40 basis points versus last year primarily due to lower online sales in the quarter.\n\nReported operating loss was $10 million; reported operating margin of negative 0.3%. \u2022 Adjusted operating income was $18 million, excluding a $47 million gain related to the sale of an\n\noffice building and $75 million of restructuring costs; adjusted operating margin of 0.5%.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 10%. \u2022 Reported net loss of $18 million; reported diluted loss per share of $0.05. \u2022 Adjusted net income of $3 million, excluding the gain on sale and restructuring costs; adjusted\n\ndiluted earnings per share of $0.01.",

Free cash flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was negative $102 million.\n\nEnding inventory of $2.3 billion was down 27% compared to last year. \u2022 Capital expenditures were $117 million. \u2022 Paid first quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, totaling $55 million. Board of Directors approved\n\nsecond quarter fiscal 2023 dividend of $0.15 per share.\n\nAdditional information regarding adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release along with a reconciliation of these measures from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the applicable period.\n\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2023 \u2013 Global Brand Results\n\nOld Navy:\n\n\u2022 Net sales of $1.8 billion, down 1% compared to last year. Sales in the quarter were driven by continued strength in the women\u2019s category offset by continued softness in the active and kid\u2019s categories as well as continued slower demand from the lower-income consumer.\n\n\u2022 Comparable sales were down 1%.\n\nGap:\n\n\u2022 Net sales of $692 million, down 13% compared to last year. Excluding the negative impact from the sale of Gap China, the shutdown of Yeezy Gap and foreign exchange headwinds, net sales were down 1% versus last year driven by continued strength in the women\u2019s category offset by continued softness in the active and kid\u2019s categories as well as strategic store closures in North America.\n\n\u2022 Comparable sales were up 1%.\n\nBanana Republic:\n\n\u2022 Net sales of $432 million, down 10% on top of 24% growth last year. Sales in the quarter were impacted as the brand lapped outsized growth last year driven by the shift in consumer preferences.\n\n\u2022 Comparable sales were down 8%.",

Sales in the quarter were impacted by continued product acceptance challenges.\n\n\u2022 Comparable sales were down 13%.\n\nFiscal 2023 Outlook\n\n\u201cAs we look to the remainder of fiscal 2023, we believe we remain well positioned to drive continued margin expansion and improved cash flow relative to last year despite what we know continues to be an uncertain macro and consumer environment,\u201d said Katrina O\u2019Connell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gap Inc. \u201cWe continue to believe we are taking the right steps toward positioning Gap Inc. back on its path towards sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s outlook takes into consideration the continued uncertain consumer and macro environment.\n\nThe company is estimating second quarter net sales could decrease in the mid to high-single digit range compared to last year\u2019s net sales of $3.86 billion. As a reminder, the sale of Gap China to Baozun Inc. closed on January 31, 2023. Second quarter 2022 net sales included approximately $60 million in sales for Gap China.\n\nThe company continues to anticipate that fiscal 2023 net sales could decrease in the low to mid-single digit range compared to last year\u2019s net sales of $15.6 billion. As a reminder, fiscal 2022 net sales included approximately $300 million in sales for Gap China. Fiscal 2023 will include a 53rd week estimated to positively impact net sales by $150 million.\n\nThe company expects second quarter and fiscal 2023 gross margin expansion compared to the prior year. At the estimated level of sales described above, the company is planning adjusted SG&A of approximately $1.3 billion in the second quarter and continues to anticipate approximately $5.2 billion for fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company now expects fiscal 2023 capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $525 million, compared to its prior range of $500 million to $550 million, reflecting lower capital project investments and fewer Old Navy and Athleta store openings than previously contemplated.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information Cammeron McLaughlin, Head of Investor Relations at Gap Inc., will host a conference call to review the company\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2023 results beginning at approximately 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. Ms. McLaughlin will be joined by Interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Martin and Chief Financial Officer Katrina O\u2019Connell.\n\nA live webcast of the conference call will be available online at investors.gapinc.com. A replay of the webcast will be available at the same location.\n\nNon-GAAP Disclosure This press release and related conference call include financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures described below are intended to provide investors with additional useful information about the company\u2019s financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. Additional information regarding the intended use of each non- GAAP measure included in this press release and related conference call is provided in the tables to this press release.",

        "text": "The non-GAAP measures included in this press release and related conference call are adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expenses/adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow, as well as expected adjusted operating expenses/adjusted SG&A. These non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of certain items that are set forth in the tables to this press release. Also note that a reconciliation of expected adjusted operating expenses/adjusted SG&A is not provided, in reliance on the exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because a comparable GAAP measure is not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be necessary for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably predict the impact of many of the costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future that could impact operating expenses/SG&A. In addition, we believe such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. The variability of those costs and expenses may be material and have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future GAAP results.\n\nThe non-GAAP measures used by the company should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in the tables to this press release below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\n\nForward-Looking Statements This press release and related conference call contain forward-looking statements within the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
